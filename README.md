# Deep-Learning
# Overview
A curated collection of Jupyter Notebooks exploring deep learning architectures, training techniques, and practical applications using TensorFlow and Keras.This repository documents my hands-on experiments with deep learning - from fundamental neural networks to advanced computer vision models. Each notebook focuses on specific concepts while maintaining production-quality implementation standards.

# Model Architectures Explored

## Core Architectures:

1. ### Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP)

2. ### Functional API Models:

 • Wide & Deep networks

 • Multi-input/multi-output architectures

 • Custom layer configurations

## Computer Vision:

1. ### From-Scratch CNNs:

 • ResNet34 implementation

 • GoogLeNet/Inception-style

 • Custom convolutional blocks

2. ### Transfer Learning:

 • EfficientNetV2B0 feature extraction

 • Fine-tuning pretrained models

# Technologies & Techniques:


• Data Augmentation (rotations, flips, zooms etc.)

• Model Optimization (Adagrad, RMSprop, Adam, Adamax, AdamW, Nesterov Momentum etc.)

• Automated Learning Rate Scheduling and Reducing (ReduceLROnPlateau etc.)

• Training and Evaluation (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, Loss and Accuracy curves)

# Datasets Used

In this repository, a variety of datasets were used to explore different types of problems:

• Fashion MNIST 

• 10-Class Food Dataset 

• Pizza vs Steak Classifier

• CIFAR-10 

• California Housing dataset etc.
